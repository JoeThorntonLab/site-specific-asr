In **data/** you can find all the initial files needed to perform the ancestral
reconstructions. 

- *_alignment.phy Contains the amino acid alignment for the protein system
- *_tree.txt Contains the phylogeny used in this work for the protein system
- *_dms_*.csv Contains the functional data values 
- *_parsimony_gaps.csv. Contains a table that summarizes the results of parsimony-based ASR of the recodified alignment to identify gaps. A for amino acid state, G for gap. Node numbering was modified to match the node numbering of DMSPhyloAA.py
